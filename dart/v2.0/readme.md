# Dart Flash Cards Version 2.0, covers Dart 2.14.4, Published Sun 7th Nov 2021

I suggest that you only work with the PDF files since they contain active links

# Download

* PDF Version ([download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sAZDdTV8RfjegHAOSSRBiaxlCY807XBq/view?usp=sharing)): contains the entire collection of the Dart Flash Cards v2.0.0 with active links
* Print Version ([download](print/)): separate PDF files per flash card so you can print them separately if you wish
* SVG Version ([download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e4wh-GCW6szW_d8V9i67NPBDfWg6Fsm1/view?usp=sharing)): I do not recommend anything other than the PDF version since anything else but the PDF cannot contain active links. But if you wish to use SVG, here you have it!
* JPG Version ([download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tCwAq2eA8Kt7dYNr66tXK0EyC6Pd01m-/view?usp=sharing)): same as SVG, but in JPG format so not vector. And no active links. Use the PDF versions for active links.
* PNG Version ([download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_VNdY3B8H-CUF6VLIvUPzrUWVnFuKB1e/view?usp=sharing)): same as JPG, but in PNG format so not vector. And no active links. Use the PDF versions for active links.
